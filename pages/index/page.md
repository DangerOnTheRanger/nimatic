Hello World!

This is an example of a site written with [Nimatic](https://github.com/DangerOnTheRanger/nimatic).
As you can see, Markdown is *fully* supported.

Go look at a [metapage](/metapage.html).

## Some code

	#!/usr/bin/env python3
	
	if __name__ == "__main__":
		print("Hello World! This is an example of Markdown-embedded code!")
